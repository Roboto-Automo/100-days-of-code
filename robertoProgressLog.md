# 100 Days Of Code - Rob's Log 2023

### Day 0: February 27 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Revised Basic Javascript exercises I had done previously on Freecodecamp and made notes*

* Escaping Literal Quotes in a String: eg. var string = "John said, \"Hello\"!";
* Escape sequences 
* Solidifying Remainder operator in my mind
* incrementing and decrementing a number variable using i++; and i--;
* Bracket notation to find values in a string: eg. var string = example let firstLetter = string[0] - returns e
* Bracket notation to find values in an array as well as accessing multidimensional arrays (nested arrays)
* Appending strings with += operators
* Finding Length of string using .length extension

*Completed new lessons on Freecodecamp*
* .push(value) to append the end of an array
* .unshift(value) to append the beginning of an array
* .shift() to to remove the first value in an array and return it
* .pop() to remove the last value of an array and return it
* functions syntax: function testfunc(param1, param2){
return param1 + param 2;
 }
 
*using markdown to write this readme*


**Thoughts:** 
Mainly setting up my workflow today, reaquainting myself with github, slack, notion and prepping for School of Code.

**Link to work:** 
* making this note to remember how to link files in a readme [My twitter account](https://twitter.com/Despirito)

### Day 1: February 28 

**Today's Progress**: 

*grinding through the Freecodecamp tutorials on Javascript data structures*

* learned a few javascript idiosyncracies in the operators.  Hadn't come across type conversion before in swift so the === and !== was new to me.
* interesting to see how functions differ from swift in the way arguments are passed
* also interesting to see that else if statements don't necessarily require the 'else' statement to return and else statement with a boolean argument.

**Thoughts:** 
Started coding late in the evening today since I have been doing a lot of setting up my new house, aim to do a lot more tomorrow.
