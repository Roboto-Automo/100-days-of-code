# 100 Days Of Code - Rob's Log 2023

      ### Day 0: February 27 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Revised Basic Javascript exercises I had done previously on Freecodecamp and made notes*

* Escaping Literal Quotes in a String: eg. var string = "John said, \"Hello\"!";
* Escape sequences 
* Solidifying Remainder operator in my mind
* incrementing and decrementing a number variable using i++; and i--;
* Bracket notation to find values in a string: eg. var string = example let firstLetter = string[0] - returns e
* Bracket notation to find values in an array as well as accessing multidimensional arrays (nested arrays)
* Appending strings with += operators
* Finding Length of string using .length extension

*Completed new lessons on Freecodecamp*
* .push(value) to append the end of an array
* .unshift(value) to append the beginning of an array
* .shift() to to remove the first value in an array and return it
* .pop() to remove the last value of an array and return it
* functions syntax: function testfunc(param1, param2){
return param1 + param 2;
 }
 
*using markdown to write this readme*


**Thoughts:** 
Mainly setting up my workflow today, reaquainting myself with github, slack, notion and prepping for School of Code.

**Link to work:** 
* making this note to remember how to link files in a readme [My twitter account](https://twitter.com/Despirito)

      ### Day 1: February 28 

**Today's Progress**: 

*grinding through the Freecodecamp tutorials on Javascript data structures*

* learned a few javascript idiosyncracies in the operators.  Hadn't come across type conversion before in swift so the === and !== was new to me.
* interesting to see how functions differ from swift in the way arguments are passed
* also interesting to see that else if statements don't necessarily require the 'else' statement to return and else statement with a boolean argument.

**Thoughts:** 
Started coding late in the evening today since I have been doing a lot of setting up my new house, aim to do a lot more tomorrow. 

      ### Day 2: March 1 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Still doing the basic Javascript module on the Freecodecamp tutorials in Javascript data structures*

* going over if else statements in Javascript and Switch Statements - making sure to add break; after each statement unlike in Swift.
* returning a boolean value in a function. eg. 
function isEqual(a, b) { return a === b;}

* Accessing object properties with dot and bracket notation and updating or deleting properties in an object.

**Thoughts:** 
Coded for about 3 hours today, A lot of the concepts I have already covered when learning Swift, but I feel I have to go over all the basics again to pick up the subtle difference in syntax as well as just refamiliarising myself with their application.  Looking forward to leaving tutorial hell and starting to implement the code on a new project.  Also need to get used to putting semi-colons at the end of statements.

My goal is to finish the whole basic javascript module by the end of the week and maybe go back over some html in VS code and make a basic webpage.  Maybe it is overly ambitious although I shouldn't be too hard on myself as I will be starting the bootcamp soon which I'm sure will prove to be intensive.

      ### Day 3: March 2 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Took a break from Javascript to revisit HTML and CSS*

After having the first pre-course session with School of Code yesterday, I realised I need to brush up on my HTML and CSS fluency.  Although I am a proficient tinkerer in the languages, at the moment, all the tools, their names and their implementation aren't quite at the tip of my tongue.

I decided to start on the technical documentation project on Freecodecamp and skip over tutorials today and see if I could build from scratch using my own knowledge.  My thinking wasn't very lateral in thinking what code to use to make the sidebar, so had to use the developer tools to work out what CSS styling was used. 

**Thoughts:** 
Spent a couple of hours today tinkering with the technical documentation website.  I'll continue with the HTML/CSS tutorials where I left off last and revise some forgotten concepts and make notes. Will try to complete all the HTML/CSS freecodecamp projects by the weeks end.
Would like to squeeze in more coding, but have a house to paint, and been distracted with deliveries and planning meals for my new work from home life.  At least the Virgin man came to bring me fast internet!

     ### Day 4: March 3 

**Today's Progress**: 

1 hour of coding mainly refamiliarising myself with Text fields, forms and buttons
* implementing and revising the code for a form field eg. <form action="mywebsite.com"><input type="text" required placeholder="required"><button type="submit">submit</button>


**Thoughts:** 
Really just managed to squeeze in the coding today after spending all day painting and being exhausted.  Made sure to write all the code out in pen in my notebook to try to memorise and comprehend.
 
      ### Day 5: March 4 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Squeezed in just over an hour of coding.
* started with edabit doing simple exercises with functions and calculations
* looked into Javascript for loops to solve an exercise and drilled into the differences between Swift for loops and Javascript For loops.  Had to get my head around setting the parameters a bit differently.  Will have to revisit this several times I am sure.  
* passed my first puzzle on codewars refactoring code using a chained ternary operator - I was familiar with the ternary operator, but it was new to me that it can be chained like an else if statement.  Also new to me that the ternary operator can be concatenated with a string when put into brackets.


**Thoughts:** 

A Light and relaxed evening session of coding that I tried to make fun after I went out for a long walk along the Enfield Lock to Chingford section of the London Loop.  Was important to blow off the cobwebs.  
 
     ### Day 6: March 5 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Hard to track how much coding maybe 3 to 5 hours on and off over a quiet Sunday evening.

 * started with codewars doing some exercises helping me to understand how to take a string as an argument and return an output based on its first and last letter.
 
*EG. Use the formula: "The" + a noun with the first letter capitalized, for example:

"dolphin" -> "The Dolphin"

However, when a noun STARTS and ENDS with the same letter, she likes to repeat the noun twice and connect them together with the first and last letter, combined into one word (WITHOUT "The" in front), like this:

"alaska" -> "Alaskalaska"*

 ![bandname generator](https://github.com/Roboto-automo/100-days-of-code/blob/master/bandname.png?raw=true)

 * I also did some exercises to help my drill down into the use of different types of For loop and what they do.  I discovered Javascript does use a For in loop, although unlike in Swift it is used to iterate over an iterable and return the indexed values as opposed to their content.  Also went over For of loops, For Each loops and regular For loops in a Sheep counting exercise.  

 *Did some VScode troubleshooting whereby Livepreview wasn't locating files I was working on.  Discovered that the whole source file needed to be imported into the workspace for them to be recognised...An important discovery to not hinder me when I will eventually be under pressure to code efficently.
 
 *Unsuccessfully tried to connect html to javascript which prompted me to go back to Freecodecamp and start some of the responsive webDesign activities.  Building a registration form.

**Thoughts:** 

Didn't feel like I accomplished as much as I would have liked even though it felt like I had spent a lot of time at the computer.  Again I hope things have been sinking in for my troubles.  Hopefully I can convert the bandname generator into a responsive web app fairly soon.
 
    ### Day 7: March 6 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Only managed codewars today, but felt like a satisfying task creating a change machine and then refactoring it once I had knowledge of a new piece of code.

  ![refactoring the change machine](https://github.com/Roboto-automo/100-days-of-code/blob/master/refactor.png?raw=true)

**Thoughts:** 

I am discovering I prefer the cerebral challenges of code problem solving even more than the UI design and implementation of HTML and CSS. Which may seem counter to my creative tendencies, but I am getting immense satisfaction from the codewars problems.  I'm looking forward to gaining enough coding knowledge to be able to start tackling the more complex problems.

 
     ### Day 8: March 7 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Started off the day with a bit of codewars, refactoring some code to make a loop and if statement much shorter.  Ended up googling for help and once again discovering a particular code snippet was required knowledge to be able to solve the problem.

 Spent about 3 hours on FreeCodecamp activities building forms.

 **Thoughts:** 

I will need to start collating all my learnings into some sort of document to help me remember what i've learned and as a simple reference to access reminders quickly.  Be it syntax or concepts.
 
     ### Day 9: March 8 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Completed Registration Form on Freecodecamp!

 **Thoughts:** 

Was good to brush up on some CSS and get myself using html so that eventually it will all become second nature.  Next thing will be to upload it to Github and brush up on git skills.
 
 
    ### Day 10: March 9 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Squeezed in a late night hour after a long day painting and creating a soundtrack for friend's short film.  Just a couple of exercises on Codewars. Utilising a for loop and getting the correct order of execution in an if else statement.

 **Thoughts:** 

Trying to relax a bit before the course starts and not overdo it as it will surely be an intense few months ahead. Good to go over the basics though.
 
 
    ### Day 11: March 10 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Just did a bit of codewars after a long day of working on the flat.  
 
 Learned about Template Literals using `` to insert a ternary operator (or any javascript expression) into a string.  
 
 eg. function chromosomeCheck(sperm) {return \`Congratulations! You're going to have a ${sperm === 'XY' ? 'son' : 'daughter'}.\`}

 **Thoughts:** 

Nice to learn a new little tidbit of code when going over simple exercises.
 
      ### Day 12: March 11 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

More Codewars  

 Learned a Lesson about spending too long trying to solve a problem, only to find that it was unsolvable at my coding level.  Now I know loops don't like to work with HUGE numbers.

 **Thoughts:** 

Good to learn this lesson when not under too much pressure.
 
    
     ### Day 13: March 12 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Day before starting bootcamp...no intense coding, just some flashcards to refresh memory on basic concepts

 **Thoughts:** 

Let the real coding commence.

 
     ### Day 14: March 13 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 First day of the School of Code.  Mostly learned about the importance of computational thinking.
 * Understanding the Problem - Making sure you are tackling the correct problem.
 * Breaking down the Problem - Making the task more manageable focusing on one small step at a time.
 * Looking for patterns - is there a way to solve the problem at scale and solve multiple problems repeat solutions?
 * Write an algorithm - this could be a basic instruction to follow, or detailed pseudocode
 * Program the solution - translate your algorithm into code.
 
 Delved briefly into Agile working systems and the importance of continual feedback to avoid early mistakes.

 **Thoughts:** 
 
 Felt engaged throughout the day, which was promising.  Made sure to get enough sleep for the following sessions.


    ### Day 15: March 14 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 More exercises in computational thinking, with emphasis on algorithmic thinking, practicing planning with flow diagrams and pseudocode before executing code.  Did an exercise in scratch to make a quick password login page that leads to a more or less game.
 
 Spent some time familiarising myself with github and ironing out some toothing issues such as establishing an ssh key and pushing to a cloned repo.
 
 Was introduced to my mentor who was very reassuring and am looking forward to our future meetings.

 **Thoughts:** 
 
 Feel like this is the calm before the storm.
 

    ### Day 16: March 15 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

* [Created this password login page](https://github.com/Roboto-Automo/Password-Login-Page)
* learned a very useful analogy to make a mental map of how code works with pointers and expressions.
* learned a few extra code function snippets: typeof(), alert(), let name = prompt(""), let name = confirm("")
* The difference between arguments and parameters in a function
* While loops, For loops, if statements, functions
* Used Chrome developer tools to test code
* Touched briefly on linking Javascript files to Html
* drilled into the difference between Null and Undefined and NaN
* data types - Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Bigint, Symbol, Object, Function
 
 
* Fat arrow function syntax
 
 const add = (x,y) => x + y;   (no need to add 'return' as it is implicit in the syntax)

 **Thoughts:** 
 
 Covered a lot of ground in quite short a space of time.  I had learned some of these fundamentals before in Swift and a little on freecodecamp, but it was good to get a different perspective and broaden my understanding of the concepts.
 
     ### Day 17: March 16 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Learned about objects and arrays and did some practice activities with partner over zoom.
 Still trying to overcome some github hurdles.
 Also did mindset training activities and delved further into johari window and also giving and receiving feedback.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
 Everything seems alright.

     ### Day 18: March 17 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Today was the hackathon in which my partner and I made a simple rock-paper-scissors game in javascript using everything we have covered up until this point as well as needing to research additional code for functionality.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
The bits we struggled on really helped cement our learning.
 
    ### Day 19: March 18 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Took the rock-paper-scissors game and added it to html to practice a bit of css and also create some extra functionality and see the logic work outside of prompts and pop-ups.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
Had to do some serious debugging to try to figure out how to get a function call from a button using "onclick=", to make the user name input stay saved to a variable in global scope across all the webpages and not just be called once and disappear.

    ### Day 20: March 19 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Took some time away from the computer to walk from NewHaven to Lewes.  Did think about code and wrote up my notes when I got home, to 'mow the lawn' and pick up a couple of tidbits I had forgotten.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
Good to get rid of some of the wired feeling and brain frazzle, ready for Monday morning!
 
     ### Day 21: March 20 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Did work on manipulating the DOM with document.querySelectors, document.getElementById(), appendChild() , document.title, 
 Managed to finish the Afternoon's task with group penny doubling scheme.
 Did more work on my Rock, Paper Scissors game in the evening to futher practice the concepts I'd learned.

 **Thoughts:** 
 
 All the concepts are sinking in, even if the precise code is coming a bit behind and more thought is needed.  Also need to relax and not overthink
 the code too much as simple things are starting to seem complex when they are indeed simple.
 
     ### Day 22: March 21 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Did some codewars activities with coding partner.  
Did exercises on EventListeners and manipulating the dom with click and input events.
Used AI tools to integrate code into Rock Paper Scissors website, Built a new website purely from html and also continued my own site with a mixture
 of AI and manual coding.

 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
Using AI is interesting as it is necessary to understand the whole code base and where it will best be integrated.  The tools are helpful but sometimes
 it is easier to do the code by yourself.
 
    ### Day 23: March 22 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Learned about Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming, fetch() and awaiting promises, SetTimeout and SetInterval functions and parsing Json files.

Also did git practice with mentor learning about git stash, git pop and merging conflicts.

 **Thoughts:** 
 need to do repeat tasks on this.

 
    ### Day 24: March 23 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Made a simple clock application, mindset and communication training, learned about accessibility in web design and had a talk about UX/UI

 

 **Thoughts:** 
 Relaxing day allowing the week to process

 
    ### Day 25: March 24 

 
**Today's Progress**: 


Hackathon day, pair programming to create a little quiz app.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
We worked well as a team and managed to get a fully functioning quiz in the short time we had.
 
    ### Day 26: March 25 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

No code today...I know it is supposed to be 100 consecutive days, but sometimes life gets in the way.  And it isn't healthy to be beholden to 
 arbitrary goals

 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
I much needed rest to be honest, even though it is supposed to be a daily practice, I think the sheer number of hours put in during the week more than makes up for a short break.
 
    ### Day 27: March 26 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

 Back on the code, 4 hours of revision tasks going over passing data to arrays, fetching API data and passing it into the dom and working with objects and arrays. 

 **Thoughts:** 
 Had to cram it in a narrow window, so hard to know how much was sinking in.

    ### Day 28: March 27 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Typing up notes and doing repetition training on certain code expressions(asynch functions, creatingElements, document.getElementByID("id-name").appendChild(variableName) )
      learned more about Agile working practices, UX/UI and started to play with CSS flexbox and CSS grid positioning items on a page.
 

 **Thoughts:** 
 
      The flex commands were a revelation in CSS styling so I am looking forward to implementing them in future projects.

 
    ### Day 29: March 28 

 
**Today's Progress**: 


 

 **Thoughts:**
