# 100 Days Of Code - Rob's Log 2023

### Day 0: February 27 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Revised Basic Javascript exercises I had done previously on Freecodecamp and made notes*

* Escaping Literal Quotes in a String: eg. var string = "John said, \"Hello\"!";
* Escape sequences 
* Solidifying Remainder operator in my mind
* incrementing and decrementing a number variable using i++; and i--;
* Bracket notation to find values in a string: eg. var string = example let firstLetter = string[0] - returns e
* Bracket notation to find values in an array as well as accessing multidimensional arrays (nested arrays)
* Appending strings with += operators
* Finding Length of string using .length extension

*Completed new lessons on Freecodecamp*
* .push(value) to append the end of an array
* .unshift(value) to append the beginning of an array
* .shift() to to remove the first value in an array and return it
* .pop() to remove the last value of an array and return it
* functions syntax: function testfunc(param1, param2){
return param1 + param 2;
 }
 
*using markdown to write this readme*


**Thoughts:** 
Mainly setting up my workflow today, reaquainting myself with github, slack, notion and prepping for School of Code.

**Link to work:** 
* making this note to remember how to link files in a readme [My twitter account](https://twitter.com/Despirito)

### Day 1: February 28 

**Today's Progress**: 

*grinding through the Freecodecamp tutorials on Javascript data structures*

* learned a few javascript idiosyncracies in the operators.  Hadn't come across type conversion before in swift so the === and !== was new to me.
* interesting to see how functions differ from swift in the way arguments are passed
* also interesting to see that else if statements don't necessarily require the 'else' statement to return and else statement with a boolean argument.

**Thoughts:** 
Started coding late in the evening today since I have been doing a lot of setting up my new house, aim to do a lot more tomorrow. 

### Day 2: March 1 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Still doing the basic Javascript module on the Freecodecamp tutorials in Javascript data structures*

* going over if else statements in Javascript and Switch Statements - making sure to add break; after each statement unlike in Swift.
* returning a boolean value in a function. eg. 
function isEqual(a, b) { return a === b;}

* Accessing object properties with dot and bracket notation and updating or deleting properties in an object.

**Thoughts:** 
Coded for about 3 hours today, A lot of the concepts I have already covered when learning Swift, but I feel I have to go over all the basics again to pick up the subtle difference in syntax as well as just refamiliarising myself with their application.  Looking forward to leaving tutorial hell and starting to implement the code on a new project.  Also need to get used to putting semi-colons at the end of statements.

My goal is to finish the whole basic javascript module by the end of the week and maybe go back over some html in VS code and make a basic webpage.  Maybe it is overly ambitious although I shouldn't be too hard on myself as I will be starting the bootcamp soon which I'm sure will prove to be intensive.

### Day 3: March 2 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Took a break from Javascript to revisit HTML and CSS*

After having the first pre-course session with School of Code yesterday, I realised I need to brush up on my HTML and CSS fluency.  Although I am a proficient tinkerer in the languages, at the moment, all the tools, their names and their implementation aren't quite at the tip of my tongue.

I decided to start on the technical documentation project on Freecodecamp and skip over tutorials today and see if I could build from scratch using my own knowledge.  My thinking wasn't very lateral in thinking what code to use to make the sidebar, so had to use the developer tools to work out what CSS styling was used. 

**Thoughts:** 
Spent a couple of hours today tinkering with the technical documentation website.  I'll continue with the HTML/CSS tutorials where I left off last and revise some forgotten concepts and make notes. Will try to complete all the HTML/CSS freecodecamp projects by the weeks end.
Would like to squeeze in more coding, but have a house to paint, and been distracted with deliveries and planning meals for my new work from home life.  At least the Virgin man came to bring me fast internet!

### Day 4: March 3 

**Today's Progress**: 

1 hour of coding mainly refamiliarising myself with Text fields, forms and buttons
* implementing and revising the code for a form field eg. <form action="mywebsite.com"><input type="text" required placeholder="required"><button type="submit">submit</button>


**Thoughts:** 
Really just managed to squeeze in the coding today after spending all day painting and being exhausted.  Made sure to write all the code out in pen in my notebook to try to memorise and comprehend.
 
### Day 5: March 4 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Squeezed in just over an hour of coding.
* started with edabit doing simple exercises with functions and calculations
* looked into Javascript for loops to solve an exercise and drilled into the differences between Swift for loops and Javascript For loops.  Had to get my head around setting the parameters a bit differently.  Will have to revisit this several times I am sure.  
* passed my first puzzle on codewars refactoring code using a chained ternary operator - I was familiar with the ternary operator, but it was new to me that it can be chained like an else if statement.  Also new to me that the ternary operator can be concatenated with a string when put into brackets.


**Thoughts:** 

A Light and relaxed evening session of coding that I tried to make fun after I went out for a long walk along the Enfield Lock to Chingford section of the London Loop.  Was important to blow off the cobwebs.  
 
 ### Day 6: March 5 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Hard to track how much coding maybe 3 to 5 hours on and off over a quiet Sunday evening.

 * started with codewars doing some exercises helping me to understand how to take a string as an argument and return an output based on its first and last letter.
 
*EG. Use the formula: "The" + a noun with the first letter capitalized, for example:

"dolphin" -> "The Dolphin"

However, when a noun STARTS and ENDS with the same letter, she likes to repeat the noun twice and connect them together with the first and last letter, combined into one word (WITHOUT "The" in front), like this:

"alaska" -> "Alaskalaska"*

 ![bandname generator](https://github.com/Roboto-automo/100-days-of-code/blob/master/bandname.png?raw=true)

 * I also did some exercises to help my drill down into the use of different types of For loop and what they do.  I discovered Javascript does use a For in loop, although unlike in Swift it is used to iterate over an iterable and return the indexed values as opposed to their content.  Also went over For of loops, For Each loops and regular For loops in a Sheep counting exercise.  

 *Did some VScode troubleshooting whereby Livepreview wasn't locating files I was working on.  Discovered that the whole source file needed to be imported into the workspace for them to be recognised...An important discovery to not hinder me when I will eventually be under pressure to code efficently.
 
 *Unsuccessfully tried to connect html to javascript which prompted me to go back to Freecodecamp and start some of the responsive webDesign activities.  Building a registration form.

**Thoughts:** 

Didn't feel like I accomplished as much as I would have liked even though it felt like I had spent a lot of time at the computer.  Again I hope things have been sinking in for my troubles.  Hopefully I can convert the bandname generator into a responsive web app fairly soon.
 
  ### Day 7: March 6 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Only managed codewars today, but felt like a satisfying task creating a change machine and then refactoring it once I had knowledge of a new piece of code.

**Thoughts:** 

I am discovering I prefer the cerebral challenges of code problem solving even more than the UI design and implementation of HTML and CSS. Which may seem counter to my creative tendencies, but I am getting immense satisfaction from the codewars problems.  I'm looking forward to gaining enough coding knowledge to be able to start tackling the more complex problems.

 
   ### Day 8: March 7 

 
**Today's Progress**: 

Started off the day with a bit of codewars, refactoring some code to make a loop and if statement much shorter.  Ended up googling for help and once again discovering a particular code snippet was required knowledge to be able to solve the problem.

 Spent about 3 hours on FreeCodecamp activities building forms.

 **Thoughts:** 

I will need to start collating all my learnings into some sort of document to help me remember what i've learned and as a simple reference to access reminders quickly.  Be it syntax or concepts.
