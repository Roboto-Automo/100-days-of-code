# 100 Days Of Code - Rob's Log 2023

### Day 0: February 27 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Revised Basic Javascript exercises I had done previously on Freecodecamp and made notes*

* Escaping Literal Quotes in a String: eg. var string = "John said, \"Hello\"!";
* Escape sequences 
* Solidifying Remainder operator in my mind
* incrementing and decrementing a number variable using i++; and i--;
* Bracket notation to find values in a string: eg. var string = example let firstLetter = string[0] - returns e
* Bracket notation to find values in an array as well as accessing multidimensional arrays (nested arrays)
* Appending strings with += operators
* Finding Length of string using .length extension

*Completed new lessons on Freecodecamp*
* .push(value) to append the end of an array
* .unshift(value) to append the beginning of an array
* .shift() to to remove the first value in an array and return it
* .pop() to remove the last value of an array and return it
* functions syntax: function testfunc(param1, param2){
return param1 + param 2;
 }
 
*using markdown to write this readme*


**Thoughts:** 
Mainly setting up my workflow today, reaquainting myself with github, slack, notion and prepping for School of Code.

**Link to work:** 
* making this note to remember how to link files in a readme [My twitter account](https://twitter.com/Despirito)

### Day 1: February 28 

**Today's Progress**: 

*grinding through the Freecodecamp tutorials on Javascript data structures*

* learned a few javascript idiosyncracies in the operators.  Hadn't come across type conversion before in swift so the === and !== was new to me.
* interesting to see how functions differ from swift in the way arguments are passed
* also interesting to see that else if statements don't necessarily require the 'else' statement to return and else statement with a boolean argument.

**Thoughts:** 
Started coding late in the evening today since I have been doing a lot of setting up my new house, aim to do a lot more tomorrow. 

### Day 2: March 1 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Still doing the basic Javascript module on the Freecodecamp tutorials in Javascript data structures*

* going over if else statements in Javascript and Switch Statements - making sure to add break; after each statement unlike in Swift.
* returning a boolean value in a function. eg. 
function isEqual(a, b) { return a === b;}

* Accessing object properties with dot and bracket notation and updating or deleting properties in an object.

**Thoughts:** 
Coded for about 3 hours today, A lot of the concepts I have already covered when learning Swift, but I feel I have to go over all the basics again to pick up the subtle difference in syntax as well as just refamiliarising myself with their application.  Looking forward to leaving tutorial hell and starting to implement the code on a new project.  Also need to get used to putting semi-colons at the end of statements.

My goal is to finish the whole basic javascript module by the end of the week and maybe go back over some html in VS code and make a basic webpage.  Maybe it is overly ambitious although I shouldn't be too hard on myself as I will be starting the bootcamp soon which I'm sure will prove to be intensive.

### Day 3: March 2 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Took a break from Javascript to revisit HTML and CSS*

After having the first pre-course session with School of Code yesterday, I realised I need to brush up on my HTML and CSS fluency.  Although I am a proficient tinkerer in the languages, at the moment, all the tools, their names and their implementation aren't quite at the tip of my tongue.

I decided to start on the technical documentation project on Freecodecamp and skip over tutorials today and see if I could build from scratch using my own knowledge.  My thinking wasn't very lateral in thinking what code to use to make the sidebar, so had to use the developer tools to work out what CSS styling was used. 

**Thoughts:** 
Spent a couple of hours today tinkering with the technical documentation website.  I'll continue with the HTML/CSS tutorials where I left off last and revise some forgotten concepts and make notes. Will try to complete all the HTML/CSS freecodecamp projects by the weeks end.
Would like to squeeze in more coding, but have a house to paint, and been distracted with deliveries and planning meals for my new work from home life.  At least the Virgin man came to bring me fast internet!
